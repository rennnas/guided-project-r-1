## Guided Project: Investigating COVID-19 Virus Trends

A pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China was first internationally reported from China on 31 December 2019. Today we know this virus as Coronavirus. COVID-19 which stands for COronaVIrus Disease is the disease caused by this virus. Since then, the world has been engaged in the fight against this pandemic. Several measures have therefore been taken to "flatten the curve". We have consequently experienced social distancing and many people have passed away as well.
 
Our analysis tries to provide an answer to this question: *Which countries have had the highest number of positive cases against the number of tests?*

In this Guided Project, we use a dataset, from `Kaggle`. This dataset was collected between the 20th of January and the 1st of June 2020.
